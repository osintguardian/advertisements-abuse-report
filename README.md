## Exoclick
Websites that use Exoclick monetization service use the following URLs and scripts on their websites, which means that seeing this is a way of verifying that a website uses Exoclick service.

```bash
1. realsrv.com
2. exdynsrv.com
3. orbsrv.com
4. optnx.com
5. exv6.com
6. exosrv.com
```
Subdomains:
```bash
1. a.realsrv.com/ads.js
2. syndication.realsrv.com
3. syndication.exdynsrv.com
4. a.exdynsrv.com
5. ads.exdynsrv.com
6. main.exdynsrv.com
7. s.orbsrv.com
8. ads.exoclick.com
```
One way to check if these domains are active on an illegal porn website is by checking the URLs that appear when you click on an ad or unannounced pop-up window. also checking incoming browser connections.
